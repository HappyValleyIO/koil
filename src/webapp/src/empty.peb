<!-- I know this sucks. BUT DON'T DELETE THIS FILE. ParcelJs 1.x doesnt come with a way to specify the root of our build
 so it just infers it from the first file it finds. That doesn't really work for us because we want `src` to be the root so that
 we retain a nice absolute path to assets and an easy way to bundle templates when we pass them back over to our java
 resources. -->

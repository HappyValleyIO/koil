            Welcome to koil! This is the starter template for your project. Everything in the `/dashboard/*` path
            is protected by authentication.

        <p>
            Your front end code lives in <strong>src/webapp</strong> and the backend lives as it normally would.
        </p>

        <p>
            While running in the <strong>dev</strong> profile in Spring, you can rebuild the project at any time to
            have
            your frontend live reload without restarting the JVM.
        </p>
